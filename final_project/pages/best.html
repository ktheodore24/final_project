              Medellín singer Feid had a busy 2020, putting out two projects, FERXXO (VOL 1: M.O.R) and BAHÍA DUCATI. He also put out a number
              of catchy singless, most notably "Mente Daña" and "CHIMBITA". The rising Colombian star followed this up with his fourth studio
              album <i>INTER SHIBUYA - LA MAFIA</i>; a collection of radio-worthy bangers. Feid teamed up with fellow Colombian and producer, Sky
              Rompiendo, and delivered a project filled with infectious melodies and ear-deafening drums and bass lines. For fifteen tracks,
              the Colombian duo take the trademark sound of reggaeton to new heights, while also adding in modern musical elements. <i>INTER
              SHIBUYA - LA MAFIA</i> gets straight to the point, with most songs averaging less than three minutes of runtime. The airy and
              atmospheric quality of each song transports the listener to a world of musical bliss, and gives them a front row seat to Feid
              and Sky Rompiendo achieving the elusive feat of crafting the perfect hit for thirty-seven minutes straight. <i>INTER SHIBUYA - LA
              MAFIA</i> is a wild ride that very few should want to get off, and is undoubtedly the best project of 2021.

          <p>It's been about three years since Vince Staples last release, <i>FM!</i>, a short but sweet album filled with explosive tracks
          you would find on any popular radio station. Hailing from Long Beach, California, Vince has always stayed true to his roots and
          represented for his hometown. Rapping about the experiences of gang life, Staples has never shied away from talking about the
          dark realities of his life. Vince's grim tales from Long Beach have always been accompanied by experimental and creative music,
          which provides the perfect backdrop for the crazy and hectic content being rapped about. On his new eponymous LP
          <i>Vince Staples</i>, we see him utilizing the same formula as <i>FM!</i>. Short songs and a short album packed with a ton of high
          quality music. Although each track has plenty of aspects for the listener to enjoy, they're not too dense, and possess enough
          mainstream sensibilities to keep anyone interested. With only twenty-three minutes of runtime, the Long Beach MC puts on
          a masterclass in music-making. Catchy hooks and a deadpan deilvery are the perfect combination that allow Vince to paint a picture
          of California living with a saturnine atmosphere. <i>Vince Staples</i> is a modern-day classic with plenty of substance and no 
          filler to be found, showcasing Vince's growth as an artist and storyteller.</p>

          <p>Joyce Wrice is one of the bright spots to come out of a highly talented field of women in R&B. Her new album <i>Overgrown</i>
          is a refreshing blend of new and old. Detailing her less than pleasurable experiences with men and dating, the Los Angeles-born
          songstress comes into her own. She demands respect and isn't shy of letting go if she feels a lack of reciprocation. Aided by her
          features including Freddie Gibbs, Westside Gunn, and KAYTRANADA, Wrice sets the mood with a soothing and lowkey tone. Her upbeat
          single "On One" featuring Freddie Gibbs shows her range, and is a callback to 90s and early 2000s R&B. "So So Sick", the album's
          second single, samples Jon B's "They Don't Know", and perfectly captures the vibe and essence of <i>Overgrown</i>. Joyce's debut 
          is nothing short of impressive, and is one of the best albums of 2021.</p>
