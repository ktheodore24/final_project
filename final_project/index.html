        <h1 class="main-article-title">Drake: Artist of the Decade</h1>
        <p class="main-article-content">In 2007 Drake released <i>Comeback Season</i>. Little did he nor his future fans know what this mixtape would do
            for his life, career, and the trajectory of hip-hop music itself. In an organic blend of R&B honesty alongside over-inflated ego
            bravado rap, a style pioneered by Kanye West, Drake managed to craft the perfect soundtrack for a new generation of music
            listeners dealing with growth and young adulthood. <i>Comeback Season</i> proved to be no fluke as Drake followed up with
            <i>So Far Gone</i>, <i>Thank Me Later</i>, and the undisputed classic <i>Take Care</i>. The Canadian-born rapper/singer had a
            knack for hits, and a decade later he continues to top the charts and sell out arenas around the world. The success story of
            Drake comes as no surprise, as we see legendary acts in all fields of entertainment defying the age old myth of "Father Time"
            (i.e. LeBron James, Tom Brady, Jay-Z, Kanye West, etc.). We're entering a new era of greatness, where an artist like Drake is
            capable of achieving massive success never before seen in hip-hop in a short amount of time, with no signs of slowing up.
            The Canadian MC has also exhibited a humbleness by not letting his ego or success get the best of him, as he still continues to
            study new artists and implement their styles in his music. The story of Drake is one of relentless passion and dedication to
            creating high quality music. He's surpassed the confines of hip-hop as a genre, and has even found success with songs across
            the musical spectrum. 2015 saw Drake enter a new arena with songs such as "Controlla" and "One Dance", a bold yet subtle
            approach to dancehall and afrobeats. "Hotline Bling", which was also released in 2015, catapulted Drake into global
            superstardom, with the music video amassing over a billion views on YouTube and counting. <i>If You're Reading This It's Too
            Late</i>, also released that year, was a tour de force in music-making. Perfectly capturing the chilly atmosphere of his
            hometown Toronto, Drake sounds cold-blooded, taking aim at his enemies and sending out warning shots for anyone who might even
            think of testing him. Drake puts on a show like no one else but he can, and takes risks never heard before in his discography.
            The story of Drake is one that is still being written, as he continues to break records and the limits of what is possible for
            an artist to achieve in this new digital era.
