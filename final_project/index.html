        <h1 class="main-article-title">Drake: Artist of the Decade</h1>
        <p class="main-article-content">In 2007 Drake released <i>Comeback Season</i>. Little did he nor his future fans know what this mixtape would do
            for his life, career, and the trajectory of hip-hop music itself. In an organic blend of R&B honesty alongside over-inflated ego
            bravado rap, a style pioneered by Kanye West, Drake managed to craft the perfect soundtrack for a new generation of music
            listeners dealing with growth and young adulthood. <i>Comeback Season</i> proved to be no fluke as Drake followed up with
            <i>So Far Gone</i>, <i>Thank Me Later</i>, and the undisputed classic <i>Take Care</i>. The Canadian-born rapper/singer had a
            knack for hits, and a decade later he continues to top the charts and sell out arenas around the world. The success story of
            Drake comes as no surprise, as we see legendary acts in all fields of entertainment defying the age old myth of "Father Time"
            (i.e. LeBron James, Tom Brady, Jay-Z, Kanye West, etc.). We're entering a new era of greatness, where an artist like Drake is
            capable of achieving massive success never before seen in hip-hop in a short amount of time, with no signs of slowing up.
            The Canadian MC has also exhibited a humbleness by not letting his ego or success get the best of him, as he still continues to
            study new artists and implement their styles in his music. The story of Drake is one of relentless passion and dedication to
            creating high quality music. He's surpassed the confines of hip-hop as a genre, and has even found success with songs across
            the musical spectrum. 2015 saw Drake enter a new arena with songs such as "Controlla" and "One Dance", a bold yet subtle
            approach to dancehall and afrobeats. "Hotline Bling", which was also released in 2015, catapulted Drake into global
            superstardom, with the music video amassing over a billion views on YouTube and counting. <i>If You're Reading This It's Too
            Late</i>, also released that year, was a tour de force in music-making. Perfectly capturing the chilly atmosphere of his
            hometown Toronto, Drake sounds cold-blooded, taking aim at his enemies and sending out warning shots for anyone who might even
            think of testing him. Drake puts on a show like no one else but he can, and takes risks never heard before in his discography.
            The story of Drake is one that is still being written, as he continues to break records and the limits of what is possible for
            an artist to achieve in this new digital era.

        <div class="feid-album-praise">
          <p>
            Medellín singer Feid had a busy 2020, putting out two projects, FERXXO (VOL 1: M.O.R) and BAHÍA DUCATI. He also put out a number
            of catchy singles, most notably "Mente Daña" and "CHIMBITA". The rising Colombian star followed this up with his fourth studio
            album <i>INTER SHIBUYA - LA MAFIA</i>; a collection of radio-worthy bangers. Feid teamed up with fellow Colombian and producer, Sky
            Rompiendo, and delivered a project filled with infectious melodies and ear-deafening drums and bass lines. For fifteen tracks,
            the Colombian duo take the trademark sound of reggaeton to new heights, while also adding in modern musical elements. <i>INTER
            SHIBUYA - LA MAFIA</i> gets straight to the point, with most songs averaging less than three minutes of runtime. The airy and
            atmospheric quality of each song transports the listener to a world of musical bliss, and gives them a front row seat to Feid
            and Sky Rompiendo achieving the elusive feat of crafting the perfect hit for thirty-seven minutes straight. <i>INTER SHIBUYA - LA
            MAFIA</i> is a wild ride that very few should want to get off, and is undoubtedly the best project of 2021.

        <p>It's been about three years since Vince Staples last release, <i>FM!</i>, a short but sweet album filled with explosive tracks
        you would find on any popular radio station. Hailing from Long Beach, California, Vince has always stayed true to his roots and
        represented for his hometown. Rapping about the experiences of gang life, Staples has never shied away from talking about the
        dark realities of his life. Vince's grim tales from Long Beach have always been accompanied by experimental and creative music,
        which provides the perfect backdrop for the crazy and hectic content being rapped about. On his new eponymous LP
        <i>Vince Staples</i>, we see him utilizing the same formula as <i>FM!</i>. Short songs and a short album packed with a ton of high
        quality music. Although each track has plenty of aspects for the listener to enjoy, they're not too dense, and possess enough
        mainstream sensibilities to keep anyone interested. With only twenty-three minutes of runtime, the Long Beach MC puts on
        a masterclass in music-making. Catchy hooks and a deadpan deilvery are the perfect combination that allow Vince to paint a picture
        of California living with a saturnine atmosphere. <i>Vince Staples</i> is a modern-day classic with plenty of substance and no 
        filler to be found, showcasing Vince's growth as an artist and storyteller.</p>

        <p>Joyce Wrice is one of the bright spots to come out of a highly talented field of women in R&B. Her new album <i>Overgrown</i>
        is a refreshing blend of new and old. Detailing her less than pleasurable experiences with men and dating, the Los Angeles-born
        songstress comes into her own. She demands respect and isn't shy of letting go if she feels a lack of reciprocation. Aided by her
        features including Freddie Gibbs, Westside Gunn, and KAYTRANADA, Wrice sets the mood with a soothing and lowkey tone. Her upbeat
        single "On One" featuring Freddie Gibbs shows her range, and is a callback to 90s and early 2000s R&B. "So So Sick", the album's
        second single, samples Jon B's "They Don't Know", and perfectly captures the vibe and essence of <i>Overgrown</i>. Joyce's debut 
        is nothing short of impressive, and is one of the best albums of 2021.</p>
